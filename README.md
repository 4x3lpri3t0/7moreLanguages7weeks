## Programming Languages:

### Lua ![lua]

Lightweight multi-paradigm programming language designed as a scripting language with extensible semantics as a primary goal. Lua is cross-platform since it is written in ANSI C and has a relatively simple C API.

Lua is commonly described as a "multi-paradigm" language, providing a small set of general features that can be extended to fit different problem types, rather than providing a more complex and rigid specification to match a single paradigm. Lua, for instance, does not contain explicit support for inheritance, but allows it to be implemented with metatables.

Lua is a dynamically typed language intended for use as an extension or scripting language, and is compact enough to fit on a variety of host platforms.

In video game development, **Lua is widely used as a scripting language by game programmers**, perhaps due to its perceived easiness to embed, fast execution, and short learning curve.
