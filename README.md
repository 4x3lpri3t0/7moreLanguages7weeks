## Programming Languages:

### ![lua] Lua

* Lightweight
* Multi-paradigm scripting language 
* Extensible semantics as a primary goal
* Cross-platform (Written in ANSI C and has a relatively simple C API)
* Small set of general features that can be extended to fit different problem types(rather than providing a more complex and rigid specification to match a single paradigm - e.g. inheritance can be implemented with metatables)
* Dynamically typed language intended for use as an extension or scripting language
* Compact enough to fit on a variety of host platforms
* ***Widely used as a scripting language by game programmers**
* Easiness to embed
* Fast execution
* Short learning curve

### ![factor] Factor

* TODO

* Stack-oriented 
* Dynamically typed 
* Automatic memory management
* Metaprogramming features
* Functional and object-oriented
* Code structured around small procedures, called words
* Something that would idiomatically be expressed with one procedure in another language would be written as several words in Factor
* Each word takes a fixed number of arguments and has a fixed number of return values
* Arguments to words are passed on a data stack (Stack is used just to organize calls to words, not as a datastructure)
